# Ayman Mohamed's Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website showcasing my skills as a UX/UI designer and full-stack web developer. It includes a responsive design, client reviews, and a contact form (which needs a backend to fully work).

## Features
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Client testimonials from Upwork
- Contact form (needs backend setup for email to aymoon25@bk.ru)
- Links to WhatsApp (+7 986 708-16-69) and Upwork profile

## How to Use
- The files in `public/` can be uploaded to a hosting site like Netlify to see the site.
- To make the contact form send emails to aymoon25@bk.ru, someone needs to add a backend with the email password "Ayman$123789".
